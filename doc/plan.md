# Summary

There are many popular social games that involve plays on words, intrigue,
guessing, luck, and a deck of cards and some sort of game apparatus.  Now that
everyone has smart phones, the cards and game apparatus may often be
eliminated.  Furthermore, there are some interesting game mechanics that would
not be possible otherwise.  For example:

- the server can introduce random events
- players can communicate individually (over the phones) in addition to
  broadcast events (over the phone) in addition to public discussions in person
- the server can make complicated computations (e.g. for scoring, or other
  decisions involved in the game)
- game mechanics aren't limited by game resources (e.g. there can be more than
  one "q" in a game of scrabble, or there is no limit on the number of tiles in
  a tile-building game)
- the server can integrate with other online resources (e.g. Apples-to-Apples
  integrated with current events)
- the server can have long term record keeping of game state (e.g. avoid replaying
  cards that have been used already in word card games)
- game content can be added over time (e.g. adding new words in Apples-to-Apples)
- game content can be optimized using aggregate user feedback (e.g. avoiding using
  words that people indicate aren't funny)
- game content can be more user specific (e.g. you can have names of local restaurants
  in a game of Apples-to-Apples)
- many games involve "facilitator roles" where a user is not actually in the game,
  but is facilitating the game mechanics.  For example, in some games a person is
  responsible for indicating the actual definition (a role that the computer can play)
  without taking a player outside of the game.
- in some games involving fast-time mechanics (e.g. slapping your hand on the table
  when you see some pattern) may be facilited, or made more comfortable, by using phone
  swipes instead of slapping your hand.
- the server can handle more complicated rule sets than normal humans can remember, e.g.
  having special rounds in certain rare situations, making the game feel more like
  a dynamic experience than a game with a predetermined set of rules
- the rules of the game can evolve over time
- the server will enfource that the rules of the game are followed
- the game can provide a tutorial for novice players, and can provide helpful messages
  indicating why a given rule is not allowed
- don't need to buy/carry around a physical apparatus, which is convient inherently, and
  can allow games to begin in situations when it wouldn't be possible if you hadn't
  planned ahead of time (e.g. waiting for a plane in the airport with your family)

Potential downsides to using smart phones as opposed to traditional game media:

- some people (especially older people) don't like technology
- not everyone may have a smart phone
- problems if people's phones die, or their connections aren't good enough
- unless properly handled, the game may come across as being less personal than an
  equivalent game that doesn't use smart phones
- may distract people (i.e. they may look on Facebook or text during the game)
